# Background
[Ptychography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptychography) is a high-resolution imaging method that has gained widespread application in [synchrontron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron) x-ray and electron microscopy. Typical ptychographic measurement requires the scanning of a [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)) beam across the sample. To ensure sufficient numerical constraint, the beam illuminated area must <span style="color: red">overlap</span> with one another for each point of the scan. The two-dimensional images collected on the detector are then fed together into an <span style="color: red">interative</span> optimizer for the [Phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_problem) retrieval process.
